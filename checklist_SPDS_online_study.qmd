A checklist for preparing and running an online study at [SPDS](https://spds.uni-konstanz.de/).


## Sites and technologies 

Conducting an online study involves multiple sites and corresponding technologies:

- [Unipark](`r url_unipark`) allows creating online experiments and surveys; 
- [Prolific](`r url_prolific`) allows recruiting and paying human participants; 
- [OSF](`r url_osf`) allows pre-registering empirical research projects.  


In addition, a generic Email account at either [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) or [uni.kn](https://uni.kn) allow interactions with participants and platforms.


## Before starting the study

### Unipark


**Design** study and implement study materials:

  - [ ] Welcome participants and provide study information (what, who, how)
  - [ ] Ask for informed consent
  - [ ] Manage interaction with recruitment platform (e.g., Prolific ID and link)
  - [ ] Provide study overview and smooth transitions between parts  
  - [ ] Provide instructions (on all goals and tasks)
  - [ ] Implement experimental manipulation(s)
  - [ ] Implement dependent variables or personality scales
  - [ ] Implement attention checks (mimicking actual items) 
  - [ ] Assess demographics 
  - [ ] Provide debriefing (without revealing too much)
  - [ ] Thank participants and link back to Prolific 
  - [ ] Use systematic names for all external variables (e.g., on Codebook page) 


**Test** the study extensively:

- [ ] Run automated tests on Unipark 
- [ ] Is study structure transparent and transitions smooth? 
- [ ] Are all study materials explained and displayed clearly? 
- [ ] Do random assignments and triggers work as intended? 
- [ ] Adjust external variable names 
- [ ] Ensure that data can be downloaded and analysed 
- [ ] Recruit human testers and incorporate their feedback into study 


**Backup** project and materials: 

- [ ] Download project (in xml-format)
- [ ] Download print version (in html- & pdf-format)
- [ ] Download codebook (showing all items and variable names)



**Prepare** for study launch: 

- [ ] Ensure sufficient buffers in date range and number of targeted participants 
- [ ] Change study URL (to a new, non-descriptive, and unique URL) 
- [ ] Ensure that study is "active" and all external links point to current URL
- [ ] Re-set the project (to delete all test data) 


### Open Science Foundation

**Goal**: Pre-register the study, specifying its hypotheses, planned analyses, and materials 

- [ ] Specify meta-data (authors, titles, etc.)
- [ ] Specify research questions, hypotheses, design, and analysis plan
- [ ] Specify criteria for excluding participants
- [ ] Add final study materials (as PDF documents)
- [ ] Submit pre-registration before starting the study (but not publishing documents yet)


### Prolific

**Goal**: Recruit and pay participants

- [ ] Provide clear study information (without revealing too much) 
- [ ] Ensure that sufficient funds are available 
- [ ] Add the final study URL from Unipark 
- [ ] Create 1 or more tiers of participants (using the same study URL and Prolific codes, to prevent repeated participation) 



## Pause and reflect 

When all the steps so far have been completed, the study is ready to be launched. 
A common error at this point is to rush it, rather than calmly consider all relevant aspects. 
Thus, take some time and reflect on the current status and the next steps: 

- [ ] Discuss the details of the current study status, its launch and management with all team members 



## During the study

**Goal**: Monitor the study's progress and ensure its smooth completion.

Beware that once a study has been started, it _cannot_ be changed or stopped. 
While the study is accessible, all relevant sites and channels are to be monitored. 


**Before** starting a study:

- [ ] Ensure that Prolific project is complete and contains the current study URL 
- [ ] Ensure that Unipark study is accessible by setting the study to "active"
- [ ] Activate recruitment of participants on Prolific 


**While** the study is running:

- [ ] Monitor Prolific project: Completed participants and flow of messages
- [ ] Monitor Unipark page (i.e., page flow information, but not results)
- [ ] Monitor Email accounts for incoming participant messages (handling all upcoming requests in a competent and friendly way)


<!-- Errors or problems: -->

In case of any errors or messages from participants, do not panic! 
Instead, calmly decide whether to first handle errors or communicate with participants. 
Small issues can sometimes be fixed, but refrain from making any big changes. 



## After the study

As soon as the last participant has left Unipark and has been registered on Prolific: 


### Unipark

- [ ] Set study to "inactive" (but not "finished")
- [ ] Download current data file (as a .zip archive)
- [ ] Check data for dropouts and unusual patterns (e.g., bots)
- [ ] Never delete any data on Unipark!


### Prolific

- [ ] Respond to any open messages 
- [ ] Pay participants (within 24h of their study completion) 
- [ ] Prepare billing information for re-claiming funds 


### Email account

- [ ] Monitor account and respond to any open messages (for a few days after study) 


### Team 

- [ ] Brief other team members on study status
- [ ] Discuss next steps with all team members 



## After analysing data 

**Goal**: Archive all materials and clean up on all accounts.  

- [ ] Ensure that all backups (including all materials, data, and documentation) are safe in multiple locations 
- [ ] Archive the study project on Unipark
- [ ] Store all project-related emails into a dedicated folder
- [ ] Submit summary of billing information to administration 
- [ ] Discuss what to do with pre-registration (whether to publish it or wait for publication draft)
- [ ] Discuss next steps with team members


<!-- Conclusion: -->

Happy online experimentation --- and may the data be with you!
