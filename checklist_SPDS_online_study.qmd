## Sites and technologies 

Conducting an online study involves multiple sites and corresponding technologies:

- [Unipark](`r url_unipark`) allows creating online experiments and surveys; 
- [Prolific](`r url_prolific`) allows recruiting and paying human participants; 
- [OSF](`r url_osf`) allows pre-registering empirical research projects.  


In addition, a generic Email account at either [Gmail](https://mail.google.com) or [uni.kn](https://uni.kn) allow interactions with participants and platforms.




## Before starting the study

### Unipark


**Design** study and implement study materials at [Unipark](`r url_unipark`):

  - [ ] Welcome participants and provide study information (what, who, how)
  - [ ] Ask for informed consent (and ensure that those not providing it cannot participate)
  - [ ] Manage interaction with recruitment platform (e.g., Prolific ID and link)
  - [ ] Provide study overview and smooth transitions between parts  
  - [ ] Provide instructions (on all goals and tasks)
  - [ ] Implement experimental manipulation(s)
  - [ ] Implement dependent variables or personality scales
  - [ ] Implement attention checks (mimicking actual items) 
  - [ ] Assess demographics 
  - [ ] Provide debriefing (without revealing too much)
  - [ ] Thank participants and link back to Prolific 
  - [ ] Use systematic names for all external variables (e.g., on Codebook page)

## Unipark tips

Here are some general tips for designing studies on [Unipark](`r url_unipark`):

- **Adapt, rather than invent**: 
Most studies do not start from scratch. To avoid repeating many mundane steps, find similar studies (or study parts) and adapt them to your needs.

- **Question formats**: 
In most cases, requiring an answer (via the DAC setting) is preferable to allowing non-answers. 
Similarly, signaling answer ranges (e.g., by displaying units, ranges, or the percentage symbol behind input fields) and constraining answer formats (e.g., by setting data type and length) facilitates subsequent data processing. However, avoid unclear expectations and allow participants some flexibility. 

- **User defined variables**: 
Use user-defined variables with random value allocation for experimental manipulations (e.g., for hiding materials based on group membership). 
When drawing random values, do this as late as possible, clearly document all options, and aim for uniform distributions. 
Delete old variables that are no longer being used.

- **Contact details**: 
Although it is important to transparently state who is conducting and funding research, it often is advisable to use a functional email address (e.g., `decision.study@uni-konstanz.de`), rather than your personal address. 

:::


**Test** the study extensively:

- [ ] Run automated tests on Unipark 
- [ ] Is study structure transparent and transitions smooth? 
- [ ] Are all study materials explained and displayed clearly? 
- [ ] Do random assignments and triggers work as intended? 
- [ ] Adjust external variable names 
- [ ] Ensure that data can be downloaded and analysed 
- [ ] Recruit human testers and incorporate their feedback into study 


**Backup** project and materials: 

- [ ] Download project (in xml-format)
- [ ] Download print version (in html- & pdf-format)
- [ ] Download Codebook (showing all items and variable names)


::: {.callout-important icon=true}

## Backups

Backups serve both _documentation_ and _restoration_ functions.   
The guiding question of making and storing backups is:   
Could we ---\ or others\ --- re-create everything if the original was lost? 

:::


**Prepare** for study launch: 

- [ ] Ensure sufficient buffers in date range and number of targeted participants 
- [ ] Change the study URL (to a new, non-descriptive, and unique URL) 
- [ ] Ensure that study is "active" and all external links point to current URL
- [ ] Re-set the project (to delete all test data) 




### Open Science Foundation

The [Open Science Foundation (OSF)](`r url_osf`) provides a free platform to support research and collaboration
We use it to pre-register empirical research projects and archive corresponding materials. 

**Goal**: Pre-register the study, specifying its hypotheses, planned analyses, and materials 

- [ ] Specify meta-data (authors, titles, etc.)
- [ ] Specify research questions, hypotheses, design, and analysis plan
- [ ] Specify criteria for excluding participants
- [ ] Add final study materials (as PDF documents)
- [ ] Submit pre-registration before starting the study (but not publishing documents yet)


### Prolific

[Prolific](`r url_prolific`) is a platform for recruiting human research participants. 

**Goal**: Recruit and pay human research participants

- [ ] Provide clear study information (without revealing too much) 
- [ ] Ensure that sufficient funds are available 
- [ ] Add the final study URL from Unipark 
- [ ] Create 1 or more tiers of participants (using the same study URL and Prolific codes, to prevent repeated participation) 



## Pause and reflect 

When all the steps so far have been completed, the study is ready to be launched. 
A common error at this point is to rush it, rather than calmly consider all relevant aspects. 
Thus, take some time and reflect on the current status and the next steps: 

- [ ] Discuss the details of the current study status, its launch and management with all team members 


::: {.callout-tip icon=true}

## Timing issues

When planning a study, consider the time zone of your participant population. 
For instance, UK time is 1 hour behind German times, and the USA lags Western European time zones by 6 to 9\ hours. 
Choose the study time so that both you and your participant population can be expected to be awake and fit for the study's entire duration.

## Better safe than sorry 

Once a study has been started, it usually _cannot_ be changed or stopped any more.  
Hence, better check and double-check everything before starting the study. 

:::


## During the study

**Goal**: Monitor the study's progress and ensure its smooth completion.

<!-- Beware that once a study has been started, it _cannot_ be changed or stopped.  -->

Before starting a study, make sure that you have updated and access to all relevant sites: 

**Before** starting a study:

- [ ] Ensure that the pre-registration at OSF has been completed and submitted (with a reasonable embargo time). 
- [ ] Ensure that Prolific project is complete and contains the current study URL 
- [ ] Ensure that Unipark study is accessible by setting the study to "active"
- [ ] Activate recruitment of participants on Prolific 


While the study is accessible and running, all relevant sites and channels are to be monitored: 

**While** the study is running:

- [ ] Monitor Prolific project: Completed participants and flow of messages
- [ ] Monitor Unipark page (i.e., page flow information, but not results)
- [ ] Monitor Email accounts for incoming participant messages (handling all upcoming requests in a competent and friendly way)



::: {.callout-tip icon=true}

## Handling problems

Here are some general tips for dealing with potential problems: 

- **Communication strategy**: 
Respond to all messages in a friendly and respectful fashion, but not necessarily immediately. 

- **Responding to feedback**: 
When participants contact you with hints, complaints, or questions, do not panic! 
Instead, calmly decide whether to first handle an issue or communicate with participants. 
Small issues can sometimes be fixed, but refrain from making any big changes. 

- **Watch out**: 
Beware of alternative communication channels (forums) and cheating attempts (e.g., by using bots or fake IP addresses). 
Many problems can be avoided or minimized by being careful and fast.

## Rinse and repeat 

Larger studies are completed in several waves. 
In this case, the study should only be accessible while real participants are being recruited (and "inactive" otherwise).

:::


## After the study

As soon as the last participant has left Unipark and has been registered on Prolific: 


### Unipark

- [ ] Set study to "inactive" (but not "finished")
- [ ] Download current data file (as a .zip archive)
- [ ] Check data for dropouts and unusual patterns (e.g., bots)
- [ ] Never delete any data on Unipark!


### Prolific

- [ ] Respond to any open messages 
- [ ] Pay participants (within 24h of their study completion) 
- [ ] Prepare billing information for re-claiming funds 


### Email account

- [ ] Monitor account and respond to any open messages (for a few days after study) 


### Team 

- [ ] Brief other team members on study status
- [ ] Discuss next steps with all team members 


::: {.callout-note icon=true}

## Cleaning up

A study is not finished when the data is collected and analyzed. 
An important aspect of responsible research is to _clean up_ various sites or tools and _document_ your analysis and results in a transparent fashion. 

:::


## After analysing data 

**Goal**: Archive all materials and clean up on all accounts.  

- [ ] Ensure that all backups (including all materials, data, and documentation) are safe in multiple locations 
- [ ] Archive the study project on Unipark
- [ ] Store all project-related emails into a dedicated folder
- [ ] Submit summary of billing information to administration 
- [ ] Discuss what to do with pre-registration (whether to publish it or wait for publication draft)
- [ ] Discuss next steps with team members


::: {.callout-note icon=true}

## A continuous process

Ideally, a study should answer some research question(s). 
However, interesting studies also motivate new questions. 
Thus, the end of a study is typically the result of future studies. 
Fortunately, the next study of a series is typically a lot easier to design than the first...
